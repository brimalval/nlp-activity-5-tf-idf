This program parses the HTML of 10 different sites (all within the "source_urls" array of the source code) and calculates the TF-IDF for each of the pages. The TF-IDF values are tallied and graphed.

Dependencies are NLTK, num2words, pandas, numpy, Beautiful Soup (package name bs4) requests, and matplotlib.
